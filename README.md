# usbTransferFile

Project made in Python to transfer files from a USB stick to the document folder. The project works mainly on Linux.

## how to work?
1. Insert the files into a folder called "files". The folder must be at the root of the USB device. 
2. Run the program first and then insert the memory and wait a few minutes for the transfer to be complete. Depending on the number of files, the transfer time may take longer.
3. The files are copied from the USB drive and go to the documents folder.
4. The project has so far only been tested on Linux (Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS)
